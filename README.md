# Event-Driven Situation Tracker – Backend

## Overview
Java-based backend responsible for processing user-created events and deriving
the current situation state. The system does not simulate data or generate
events automatically.

## Tech Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Gradle
- REST API

## Architecture
The backend acts as the single source of truth. All business logic and
state derivation are handled server-side.
